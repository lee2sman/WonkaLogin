Play Willy Wonka's mysterious flute melody when you open a new Terminal window

Note: This is a blatant copy of the methods written by Quinn Keaveney for [ZeldaLogin](https://github.com/qkeave/ZeldaLogin).

Just place the mp3 in your home/user directory and add the .bash_profile.
In case you already have stuff in your .bash_profile, just add 
```
Afplay Wonka-flute.mp3
```

If you want to hide the mp3... which you probably do... just copy this into your "secret" terminal
```
cd
chflags hidden Wonka-flute.mp3
```
On Linux I think it's chgflags instead.

I found the sound file on Beemp3
